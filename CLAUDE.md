## Repository Purpose

This is a GitHub profile README repository (username: arctronic). The README.md file displays on the GitHub profile page at github.com/arctronic.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md` - Main profile page content with bio, tech stack, projects, and GitHub stats
- `.git/` - Git repository data

## Working with This Repository

### Editing the Profile

The README.md uses:
- GitHub-flavored Markdown
- Centered content sections with `<div align="center">`
- Badge shields from shields.io (img.shields.io)
- Dynamic GitHub stats widgets:
  - Typing animation: readme-typing-svg.demolab.com
  - Profile views: komarev.com/ghpvc
  - GitHub Streak: streak-stats.demolab.com
  - GitHub Stats: github-readme-stats.vercel.app
  - Activity Graph: github-readme-activity-graph.vercel.app
- Credly certification badges: images.credly.com

### Profile Content Sections

1. **Terminal Greeting** - Animated typing effect showing username and roles (Everstar + BinduLogic)
2. **About Me** - Professional summary prioritizing Everstar (3M+ NRC docs) first, BinduLogic (2M+ patients, 14+ facilities) second
3. **Tech Stack** - Organized by category with Backend/Data/DevOps emphasis:
   - Backend & Data Engineering (Python, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Airflow, Vector DBs, ETL)
   - DevOps & Cloud Infrastructure (Docker, Ansible, AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, Terraform)
   - Security & Compliance (Cybersecurity, Encryption, HIPAA, Access Control)
   - AI/ML (RAG, GraphRAG, LLMs, NLP, Computer Vision)
   - Frontend (React, Next.js, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS)
4. **Featured Projects** - 2x2 grid layout showcasing:
   - Gordian AI (Everstar)
   - BinduLogic Hospital Management
   - Temp-Mail.lol
   - AlgoSketch
5. **GitHub Statistics** - Three dynamic widgets:
   - Contribution Streak
   - GitHub Stats (commits, stars, PRs)
   - Contribution Activity Graph
6. **Professional Certifications** - 2x3 grid of Credly badges (IBM Cybersecurity Analyst, etc.)
7. **Footer** - Contact links with social badges and call-to-action

### Updating Profile Information

When updating the profile:
- **Terminal greeting** - Update roles in typing animation if job titles change
- **About Me section** - Everstar is prioritized first (3M+ NRC documents), BinduLogic second (2M+ patients, 14+ facilities)
- **Tech Stack** - Emphasizes Backend/Data Engineering and DevOps over Frontend
- **Featured Projects** - Uses 2x2 table grid (not list format)
- **Professional Certifications** - Uses Credly badges (not GitHub trophies)
- Keep professional tone and factual information
- Update experience years and project counts as they change
- Ensure all badge URLs and external links remain valid
- Maintain consistent badge styling (style=flat-square for small badges, style=for-the-badge for footer)
- Use appropriate theme (radical) for stat widgets to match profile aesthetics

### Testing Changes

Preview Markdown rendering:
```bash
# View README locally (if markdown viewer installed)
# Or push to GitHub and view at github.com/arctronic
```

Note: GitHub stats widgets and Credly certification badges update automatically based on GitHub activity and Credly account. No manual updates needed for contribution graphs, stats, or certification counts.
